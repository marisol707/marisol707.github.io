Marisol’s Personal StatementMy backgroundI was born in Guatemala, a small country that is located on the south border of Mexico, in Central America. I came to the US 7 years ago, I have been working for the Woods College for almost 6 years, I started as Staff and Project Assistant and then promoted in 2016 to Communications and Events Specialist where I began to learn basics about webpage editing.My interest in Web developmentAs part of my current position, I was trained on editing our website. That was a challenge because I did not have previous experience but I ended enjoying this aspect of my new job. Not being a designer, and having just the basics on web editing, I discovered that I have a “good eye and sense” about design which has been really helpful. What I hope to gain from this courseI learned the basics about the editing webpages but I really would like to know-how are the pages built, how items communicate with each other in order to work properly.
